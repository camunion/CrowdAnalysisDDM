These cells are multiciliated, with motile cilia that play key physiological roles. It is shown that the ciliary beat frequency can be recovered to match conventional analysis, but in a fully automated fashion. Furthermore, it is shown that the properties of spatial and temporal coherence of cilia beat can be recovered and distinguished, and that if a collective traveling wave (the metachronal wave) is present, this has a distinct signature and its wavelength and direction can be measured."

abstract  ="Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) was used to investigate the diffusive dynamics of nanoparticles of diameter 200–400 nm that were strongly confined in a periodic square array of cylindrical nanoposts. The minimum distance between posts was 1.3–5 times the diameter of the nanoparticles. The image structure functions obtained from the DDM analysis were isotropic and could be fit by a stretched exponential function. The relaxation time scaled diffusively across the range of wave vectors studied{,} and the corresponding scalar diffusivities decreased monotonically with increased confinement. The decrease in diffusivity could be described by models for hindered diffusion that accounted for steric restrictions and hydrodynamic interactions. The stretching exponent decreased linearly as the nanoparticles were increasingly confined by the posts. Together{,} these results are consistent with a picture in which strongly confined nanoparticles experience a heterogeneous spatial environment arising from hydrodynamics and volume exclusion on time scales comparable to cage escape{,} leading to multiple relaxation processes and Fickian but non-Gaussian diffusive dynamics."}

abstract={We propose a methodology that incorporates k-means and improved watershed segmentation algorithm for medical image segmentation. The use of the conventional watershed algorithm for medical image analysis is widespread because of its advantages, such as always being able to produce a complete division of the image. However, its drawbacks include over-segmentation and sensitivity to false edges. We address the drawbacks of the conventional watershed algorithm when it is applied to medical images by using k-means clustering to produce a primary segmentation of the image before we apply our improved watershed segmentation algorithm to it. The k-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm, while the improved watershed segmentation algorithm makes use of automated thresholding on the gradient magnitude map and post-segmentation merging on the initial partitions to reduce the number of false edges and over-segmentation. By comparing the number of partitions in the segmentation maps of 50 images, we showed that our proposed methodology produced segmentation maps which have 92% fewer partitions than the segmentation maps produced by the conventional watershed algorithm},
